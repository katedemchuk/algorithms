**Big O Notation**: A framework for evaluating the efficiency of code in solving problems and comparing different solutions.

But what does "efficient code" really mean? Typically, it refers to code that is:
- Fast
- Memory-efficient
- Readable

To measure the speed of code, execution time can be calculated using timers. However, relying solely on physical execution time is unreliableâ€”it depends on machine characteristics and may vary even on the same machine. Instead, a better approach is to analyze the number of basic operations the computer performs during execution.

Big O simply describes a relationship between the size of the input and how the runtime of the algorithm growth depending on it.
