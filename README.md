What does efficient code actually mean?
Probably:
- fast
- memory-efficient
- readable

To assess speed of the code, the time of execution can be calculated with timers.
Since counting physical time duration of code execution is not reliable enough - depends on characteristics
of machines and may vary as well while beling executed on the same machine.
Counting number of simple operations computer performs during the code execution.


**Big O Notation**: A framework for evaluating the efficiency of code in solving problems and comparing different solutions.

But what does "efficient code" really mean? Typically, it refers to code that is:
- Fast
- Memory-efficient
- Readable

To measure the speed of code, execution time can be calculated using timers. However, relying solely on physical execution time is unreliableâ€”it depends on machine characteristics and may vary even on the same machine. Instead, a better approach is to analyze the number of basic operations the computer performs during execution.
