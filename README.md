> Big O notation - a framework to assess code efficiency to solve a problem and compare different solutions.

What does efficient code actually mean?
Probably:
- fast
- memory-efficient
- readable

To assess speed of the code, the time of execution can be calculated with timers.
Since counting physical time duration of code execution is not reliable enough - depends on characteristics
of machines and may vary as well while beling executed on the same machine.
Counting number of simple operations computer performs during the code execution.
